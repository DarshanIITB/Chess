# Chess App using React
This repo is just me building a chess app using ReactJS with the chess logic written natively.
The final project will contain logic to parse PGNs and FENs(already implemented) and will allow imports and exports.

## Overview of the Code
src/arbiter - contains chess rules
src/assets, src/components, src/screens - self-explanatory i presume
src/utils - contains parsing logic and other utility functions
